# RFCAndRSACombineCipher
The Rail Fence cipher can be easily cracked through modern cryptography attacks and techniques. The new implementation of Rail Fence Cipher will be introduced which I call Rail Fence and  Rivest Shamir Adleman Combine Cipher which is going to enhance its security and provide a modern solution to such a vulnerable and valuable cipher. With this implementation and innovation of the Rail Fence cipher, two knowledgeable attacks (brute force, and frequency distribution) that this cipher is weak against will once again be strengthened. This is achieved through implementation of Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSI) cipher.
